The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and it has got 30 parameters to consider. For confidentiality, all the parameters except the amount of transaction and the time of transaction has been normalized and the actual paramter name is hidden. 

SMOTE was used to resample the data, as the data is heavily unbalanced.
